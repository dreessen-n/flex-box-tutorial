# flex-box-tutorial

```I created this tutorial to help with flexbox```

To use this:

- [ ] In the assets folder there are 3 images: step1, step2 and step3
- [ ] Open them in sequential order and follow directions in comments in style.css
- [ ] Adjust: size, layering, flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis, and flex-direction as needed

```This is just one way to do it, but very basic and minimal. Find your way. This is only a suggestion```

```Hope this helps anyone```
